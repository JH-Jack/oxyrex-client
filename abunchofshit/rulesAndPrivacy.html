                <p>
                    We know that data collection is important to you, so it is our goal to be as transparent as possible.
                    We do collect your IP address when you join our game servers. Once your IP is read from the WebSocket information,
                    it is immediately hashed using SHA256, and only used to stop multiple tabs being opened, and to block banned users.
                    If you end up getting banned from the game, your hashed IP address will be saved to a secure database. We never deal
                    with raw IP addresses. When you connect to the main site, your IP is again hashed and only used for differentiating between
                    users for seeing how many different people join the game within time periods. <strong>In either case, your IP is never
                    seen by anyone and is encrypted with SHA256, which is a secure hashing algorithm to protect your data. Unless you are banned,
                    your IP is never saved.</strong>
                    Even when you are banned, the hash of the IP address is stored. We block all VPN or Proxy IP connections, and you will
                    be forced to disable the VPN or Proxy in order to join.
